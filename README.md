A movie recommendation system built with TensorFlow that uses collaborative filtering with neural networks to provide personalized movie recommendations.
---

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a neural collaborative filtering approach to movie recommendations using the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).  
The system analyzes user-movie interactions to detect patterns in viewing preferences and makes personalized suggestions based on learned behaviors.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Neural network-based collaborative filtering  
- 🎯 Personalized recommendation generation  
- 🧩 User and movie embedding visualization  
- 🧹 Data preprocessing and exploration  
- 🧠 Model training and evaluation  
- 📊 Visualization of recommendation patterns  

---

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

The recommendation engine is built with TensorFlow and uses:

- 🔗 Embedding layers for users and movies  
- 🧱 Dense neural network layers for learning interaction patterns  
- 🛡️ Regularization techniques to prevent overfitting  
- 📉 Visualization tools to understand learned relationships  

---

## 🎬 Dataset

We use the [MovieLens Small Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) which includes:

- 100,000+ ratings  
- 9,000+ movies  
- 600+ users  
- Ratings from 0.5 to 5.0  
- Metadata: titles, genres, release years

## 🛠️ Installation

---

## ▶️ Usage

from movie_recommender import MovieRecommender

# Initialize the recommender
recommender = MovieRecommender()

# Download and load the dataset
recommender.download_dataset()
recommender.load_data()

# Train the model
train_data, val_data = recommender.prepare_training_data()
history = recommender.train_model(train_data, val_data, epochs=10)

# Get recommendations for a user
recommendations = recommender.get_movie_recommendations(user_id=42, top_n=10)
print(recommendations)

## 📈 Results

- 📉 Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~0.7 stars  
- ✅ Recommendations verified through cross-validation  
- 🌀 Meaningful clusters in movie embedding space  

---

## 🗺️ Embedding Visualization

![Movie Embedding Space](https://github.com/RanuK12/movie-recommender/blob/main/movie_embeddings.png)

The t‑SNE visualization shows how the model clusters similar movies together in the latent embedding space.  
Genres and themes naturally group, proving the model has learned useful representations.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 🧠 Integration of content-based features  
- 🧲 Implementation of attention mechanisms  
- ❄️ Support for cold‑start problems  
- 🌐 Simple web interface for live recommendations
